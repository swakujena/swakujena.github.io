       A lifetime passes before a sigh shows its effects
       Who would wait so long to see you fixing the tangles in     
       your hair.<br>
       A hundred dragon mouths create a net of waves from a single  
       ocean Oh what a task it is for a drop to turn into a pearl. 
       <br>
       Love needs patience but lust is restless
       What color should my heart be, till it bleeds to death.<br>
       I know you will not ignore me, but By the time you know of   
       me, I would have turned to ash.<br>
       Each drop of dew is aware that it can be destroyed with the  
       rays of the sun.<br>
       I will survive similarly, till you glance at me
       Your glances can bring my life to end.<br>
       As dancing sparks bring an end of a fun filled gathering
       Life is all suffering,<br> Asad, it can be cured with death
       The candle burns in many colors till the morning comes.
